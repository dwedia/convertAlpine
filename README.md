# convertAlpine
Oneshot container that converts all HEIC files in the current folder to jpeg.

## Why?
I relatively often have to convert .HEIC images to a different usable format. After having to do it on different computers from time to time, I got annoyed with having to get Image Magick to work on different Distroes. This container is the result.

## Installation
Copy the runConvertAlpine.sh file to a folder in your path

## Usage
1. Navigate to the folder containing the .HEIC files.
2. run runConvertAlpine.sh and let the container do its work.
